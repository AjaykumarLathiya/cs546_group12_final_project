CS-546 Final project

About:

Due to this pandemic, most of the business is doing their operations online, so are these salons. In this way clients love making appointments online allows them to book whenever and wherever they want, gives them better control over the date and time and eliminates the need to talk on the phone (some people find it very stressful). Even salon owners love this way as it avoids so many misunderstandings, we don’t need receptionists and the best part is you have all the data in one place. This system will provide the functionalities of manage salons’ details, manage day by day bookings, manage issuing many reports (barber report review report, booking report etc.), manage service, manage employee details, manage customer details and manage notification system for day to day transactions. This system will help to improve the higher efficiency in the processes in the salons

Motivation:

It will enable salon staff to add data to the system without bothering about creating report formats that will increase the efficiency of salon staff. This system will use employee’s ids and passwords for employees to access the system. In this case salon’s confidential data will not be available to the unauthorized access Here in this website, we are allowing client to book an appointment in the Appointment book (which is a calendar).
